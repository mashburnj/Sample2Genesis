# SampleToYM2612
 ML model for predicting the register settings for a single patch for the Yamaha YM2612 sound chip used in the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. To be precise, it bases its prediction on the spectrum of an audio sample. The model will be trained using the spectra (features) and chip registers (targets) of samples taken from the output of a Sega Genesis.
